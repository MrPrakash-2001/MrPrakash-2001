### ✨ About Me

I'm a Backend-Focused Full Stack Developer with a passion for building scalable, real-time web applications. Currently working as a **Junior Programmer Analyst at Srinsoft Technologies**, I specialize in crafting full-stack solutions using **Node.js**, **Angular**, **PostgreSQL**, and **MongoDB**.

I’ve independently developed and delivered complete applications for internal use, such as:
- A real-time **Assessment Tool** with full-screen monitoring and tab switch detection.
- A **Document Management System (DMS)** with role-based workflow (upload → review → approval).
- A comprehensive **Warehouse Management System** with modules for check-ins, shipments, and barcode integration.

🔍 I focus on:
- Writing clean, maintainable code  
- Fast learning & deep self-analysis  
- Delivering on time without compromising quality  
- Building both independently and within a team  

🚀 I’m currently learning:
- **React**, **Docker**, and **AWS** to level up my DevOps and frontend skills

🎯 Career Goal:
To grow into a **Senior Backend/Full Stack Developer** role where I can drive performance, lead architecture decisions, and build real-time systems at scale.
